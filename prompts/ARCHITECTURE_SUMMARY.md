# Taskfile Architecture Implementation Summary

## ✅ Architecture Successfully Established

The Taskfile architecture has been implemented according to the specified hierarchy:

### 📁 Directory Structure Created

- ✅ `@Taskfile.yml` (root) - includes `@taskfiles/`
- ✅ `@taskfiles/` - contains all taskfile includes
- ✅ `@scripts/` - root-level cross-cutting scripts
- ✅ `@backend/scripts/` - backend service management scripts
- ✅ `@frontend/scripts/` - frontend microfrontend scripts
- ✅ `@database/scripts/` - database management scripts
- ✅ `@tests/infrastructure/scripts/` - testing infrastructure scripts
- ✅ `@prompts/` - contains architecture documentation

### 🔗 Path Resolution Patterns

**Root Taskfile.yml → Taskfiles → Scripts hierarchy is now established:**

1. **Root Taskfile.yml** uses `@taskfiles/` for modular task organization
2. **Taskfiles in @taskfiles/** use:
   - `@scripts/` for cross-cutting concerns (port management, deployment)
   - `@backend/scripts/` for backend service operations
   - `@frontend/scripts/` for frontend build processes
   - `@database/scripts/` for database operations
3. **Domain-specific Taskfiles** use their own script directories:
   - `@frontend/Taskfile.yml` uses `@frontend/scripts/`
   - References to root scripts use `../scripts/` when needed

### 📝 Documentation Created

1. **`prompts/TASKFILE_ARCHITECTURE.md`** - Comprehensive architecture enforcement guide for LLMs
2. **`prompts/ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md`** - This summary document
3. **`scripts/validate-architecture.sh`** - Validation script for ongoing compliance

### 🎯 Key Scripts Added

**Backend Scripts (@backend/scripts/):**

- `start-all-services.sh` - Orchestrates backend service startup
- `stop-all-services.sh` - Gracefully stops all backend services

**Validation Script (@scripts/):**

- `validate-architecture.sh` - Ensures architecture compliance

### 🔐 Enforcement Rules

The architecture enforces these patterns for all LLM interactions:

1. **No absolute paths** - All paths are relative
2. **Clear domain separation** - Scripts live in appropriate domain directories
3. **Consistent naming** - Follows established patterns
4. **Executable permissions** - All shell scripts are executable
5. **Documentation requirements** - All changes must update relevant documentation

### 🚀 Usage Examples

**Correct patterns now established:**

```yaml
# In taskfiles/Taskfile.dev.yml
- ../backend/scripts/start-all-services.sh # ✅ Correct
- scripts/port-manager.py generate # ✅ Correct

# In frontend/Taskfile.yml
- ./scripts/build-microfrontends.sh # ✅ Correct
```

The architecture is now ready for use and will serve as the foundation for all future LLM interactions and code generation in this project.
